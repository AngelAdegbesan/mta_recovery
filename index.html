      <p> The purpose of this project is to determine how public transit ridership has changed in New York City in a year.</p>

      <p> For this project we examined the turnstile and metro card swipes data from the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the state agency that runs the city’s subways and buses. We use both data sets to compare subway ridership in the first four
        months of 2021 to the first four months of 2022. </p>

      <p> Our hypothesis is that the number of users entering a subway station will have increased year over year. We also hypothesize that the number of users swiping a metro card will have decreased, given the widespread availability of OMNY
        systems that allows users to tap a contactless card to pay the fare. We believe it would have impacted the use of traditional metro cards. </p>

      <p> First, we pulled the turnstile data from Jan TK, 2021 to April TK, 2021 as well as from Jan TK, 2022 to April TK, 2022. The data was divided into weekly numbers that contained the date, time, and number of entries and exits for turnstiles
        at over 400 subway stations. Then, we sorted and analyzed the data to ultimately derive three categories: the station names, dates and the number of entries. We further compressed the weekly dates into months, so we have the total number of
        turnstile entry at each subway station for the months of January, February, March and April in both 2021 and 2022.  </p>

      <p>Then, we pulled the metro card data from the MTA that shows the type and number of metro card used at each subway station per week. Again, we pulled data from Jan TK, 2021 to April TK, 2021 as well as from Jan TK, 2022 to April TK, 2022.
        Similar to the turnstile data, we sorted and analyzed the data to give us three categories: the station names, dates, total number of metro cards used. Then, we compressed the weekly dates into months, so we have the total number of swipes at
        each subway station for the months of January, February, March and April in both 2021 and 2022. </p>
      <p> After sorting, we were able to derive the kind of Swipe dataset and Turnstile dataset that we liked from each scrape. Then we made simple calculations on the numbers to find out the percent difference from the previous year’s for both
        datasets.  </p>

      <p>Ultimately, we found out two things which are the complete opposite of our hypothesis: in most stations, people entering the subway system typically decreased and the number of metrocard swiped into a station typically increased in 2022.
        Overall, we found that the number of swipes in the first four months of 2022 increased by an average of 47 percent from the same period in 2021. On the other hand, the number of people entering a subway station in the first four months of
        2022 only increase by an average of 15 percent from the same period in
        2021. </p>

      <p> Why? We theorize that the reduced number of people entering the stations could be because of the omicron variant that led many workers to return to remote work.
      </p>

            <h2>Noteworthy</h2>
            <h3>Upon surveying of the data, we see that a typical station has an increased number of swipes in the four month period of 2022 compared to 2021, while a typical station has a decreased number of people actually entering the station
              using
              the turnstile. Yet, after calculation, we see that the average of both datasets shows increases. Then we noticed the outliers: </h3>

        <div id="outlier1" class="dot blue">
          <a class="close fa fa-times" href="#"></a>
          <div class="inner">
            <h2>Outlier one</h2>
            <h3> Unlike other stations where there was a decrease in turnstile entry, the 72nd street-2nd Avenue station had a phenomenal 1,784% increase in the number of people entering the station via turnstiles for the first four months of 2022.
              It also had a 24% increase in the number of people swiping into the station. </h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="outlier2" class="dot pink">
          <a class="close fa fa-times" href="#"></a>
          <div class="inner">
            <h2>Outlier two</h2>
            <h3> Unlike other stations where there was a decrease in turnstile entry, the Hewes Street-Broadway station had a 695% increase in the number of people entering the station via turnstiles for the first four months of 2022. On the other
              hand, it only had a 7.5% increase in the number of people swiping into the station. </h3>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p> We also wanted to see if there were possible outliers that corresponded with our original hypothesis. So we compared the swipe numbers and turnstile entry numbers of each station to see if there were
        cases where swipe decreased and entry
        increased. </p>

      <p> We encountered a roadblock with this where we found out that the subway stations in the Swipe dataset were named differently from the subway stations in the Turnstile dataset. After filtering and sorting in Excel, we were able to find about
        100 out of more than 400 subway stations that were named similarly. We used the VLookup function in Excel to match the turnstile numbers and swipe numbers for these stations. </p>

      <p>From there, we discovered two outliers that corresponded with our initial hypothesis. The Hewes Street-Broadway and the 72nd Street-2nd Avenue stations had an increased number of people entering the station in 2022 compared to the previous
        year’s, and had a decreased or slightly increased number of people swiping a metro card.</p>

        <p>So overall, we found out that subway ridership in New York is nowhere on track to reaching pre pandemic levels as current levels are still below 2021’s. Senior officials have said the MTA will probably need until 2035 to match pre-covid
          levels ///The MTA has stated that they are in crisis wktk because of ridership and need the funds to survive. To supplement depleting revenue from low ridership, the MTA is also considering raising fares, and a proposed congestion fee for
          riders in Manhattan that will bring about $1 billion in revenue. The MTA anticipates allow the MTA to borrow against the revenue made from the congestion fees. ???? </p>
